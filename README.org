* download stock prices from EODHD and parse for [[https://ledger-cli.org/][ledger]] [[https://ledger-cli.org/doc/ledger3.html#Commodities-and-Currencies][price db]]

tracking the casino of commodified human labor, i.e. the value of your stock portfolio.

other people have done [[https://plaintextaccounting.org/#data-generation][overall better jobs]] at this, but I couldn't figure out to get ETF data sources, so I hacked together this script.


** Setup
- get an API KEY from https://eodhd.com/financial-apis/api-for-historical-data-and-volumes
- install ~httr~, `jsonlite`, `purrr`, `data.table`, `magrittr`
- create a commodify.R file (see example) which defines
  - `dt_stock_ids`: a data.table with columns `ticker` (for EODHD API) and `name` (commodity name used in ledger file)
  - the API_KEY
  - `FILE_EOD_FULL` and `FILE_EOD_PRICEHIST`: files to save the EOD data and ledger price db, respectively
  - `gd_eod(dt_stock_ids)`: fetches and writes data
- run this file via `Rscript commodify.R` (add it to cron if you like)
  

** Limitations
- the EODHD API is limited to 20 calls a day, each stock requires 1 call, so after free sign-up credits expire run it's limited to 20 stocks (would have used [[https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance][yfinance]] if I'd known of it before)
- Exchange XETRA and currency EUR are currently hardcoded
- only tested on linux
